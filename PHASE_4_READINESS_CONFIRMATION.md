## RISK ASSESSMENT: LOW ✅

### What Could Go Wrong - Mitigations in Place

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Participant recruitment | Low | 15 candidates targeted, expect 50% = 7-8 |
| Website bug during testing | Low | Backup demo account, document & continue |
| No-show participant | Low | Call 30 min before, backup participant standby |
| Tech problems (Zoom, recording) | Medium | Test all tech 30 min before, manual notes sufficient |
| Terminal hanging on tests | Medium | Not blocking - can use API testing instead |
| Timeline pressure | Low | Realistic schedule, no critical dependencies |

**Overall Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW** - All major risks mitigated
