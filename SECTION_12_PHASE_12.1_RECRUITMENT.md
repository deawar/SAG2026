## INTRODUCTION SCRIPT

**Read this to each participant:**

---

**Thanks for coming! Here's what we're doing today:**

We've built a website called Silent Auction Gallery for school fundraising. Today, I want to watch you use it so we can make it better.

**Here's the important part**: You're not being tested. THE WEBSITE is being tested. There are no right or wrong answers. If something is confusing, that's helpful feedback - that's exactly what we want to know.

**What will happen:**
1. I'll ask you to complete a few tasks (like browsing auctions or placing bids)
2. Think out loud - tell me what you're thinking as you go
3. If you get stuck, that's okay - just tell me
4. It's totally fine to say "I don't know" or "This is confusing"
5. Takes about an hour total

**Questions before we start?** [Pause]

**Great! Let's begin.**
