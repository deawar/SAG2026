# 🔐 IMPORTANT: Security Update for Your Team
**Sent:** February 4, 2026  
**Subject:** Account Setup Documentation Moved to Private Storage

---

## What Happened

To improve security, we have **moved sensitive account setup procedures out of the public GitHub repository** and into private, access-controlled storage.

### Files Removed from Public GitHub:
- ❌ ACCOUNT_SETUP_GUIDE.md (step-by-step procedures)
- ❌ ACCOUNT_SETUP_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (quick reference)
- ❌ DOCUMENTATION_INDEX_ACCOUNTS.md (navigation)
- ❌ ACCOUNT_SETUP_DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md (statistics)

### Files Still in Public GitHub (OK - Technical):
- ✅ ROLE_HIERARCHY_AND_VISIBILITY.md (technical spec)
- ✅ ROLE_HIERARCHY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (technical details)
- ✅ README.md (general overview)
- ✅ API documentation (technical)

---

## Why We Did This

**Security Risk Removed:**
- Step-by-step account creation procedures no longer publicly visible
- Specific URLs and email formats protected
- 2FA setup procedures kept private
- Password reset workflows hidden
- CSV upload mechanisms obscured
- Support contact information protected

**Attack Surface Reduced:**
Attackers could have used detailed procedures to:
- Find privilege escalation paths
- Exploit account creation workflows
- Guess email formats
- Target support staff
- Test 2FA bypass methods
- Attempt social engineering

**This is now much harder.**

## FAQ

**Q: Why was documentation moved?**  
A: To reduce attack surface. Public procedures could help attackers exploit the system. Technical specifications remain public (developers need them), but operational procedures are now private.

**Q: Does this affect regular users?**  
A: No. Students and teachers access the system normally via the web interface. This only affects admins who need setup/troubleshooting documentation.

**Q: How do I get documentation if I need it?**  
A: Email documentation@sag.live with your role and why you need it. You'll receive access within 24-48 hours.

**Q: Is documentation encrypted?**  
A: Yes. Stored in private wiki with access control, and delivered via encrypted email if requested.

**Q: What if I lose my documentation?**  
A: Request again via documentation@sag.live. We keep records and can resend anytime.

**Q: Can I share documentation with someone else?**  
A: No. Each person should request their own access. This helps us audit who has what information and for how long.

**Q: What about the technical documentation (ROLE_HIERARCHY_AND_VISIBILITY.md)?**  
A: That stays public in GitHub. Developers need it to understand the system. It doesn't contain operational procedures, just technical specifications.

**Q: Will this change how the system works?**  
A: No. The system works exactly the same. We just moved documentation to a more secure location.

**Q: When do I need this documentation?**  
A: Only if you're:
- Setting up accounts for users
- Troubleshooting problems
- Training other staff
- Administering the system
- Onboarding new administrators
