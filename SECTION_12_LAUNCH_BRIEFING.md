## INTRODUCTION TO READ TO PARTICIPANTS

---

**"Thanks for coming! Here's what happens today:**

**We've built a website called Silent Auction Gallery for school fundraising. Today, I want to watch you use it so we can make it better.**

**Here's the important part: You're not being tested. THE WEBSITE is being tested. There are no right or wrong answers.**

**If something's confusing, that's exactly what we want to know.**

**What will happen:**
1. I'll ask you to complete a few tasks (like browsing auctions or bidding)
2. Think out loud - tell me what you're thinking
3. If you get stuck, that's okay - just tell me
4. You can say "I don't know" or "This is confusing"
5. Takes about an hour

**Questions? Let's begin.**"

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk: Participants Don't Confirm
**Mitigation**: Target 15 candidates, expect 50% conversion = 7-8 confirmations

### Risk: Website Bug Found During Testing
**Mitigation**: Have backup demo account, document issue, note observation

### Risk: Participant Doesn't Show Up
**Mitigation**: Call 30 min before, have backup participant standby

### Risk: Tech Problems (Zoom, Recording)
**Mitigation**: Test all tech 30 min before, manual notes sufficient

### Risk: Testing Takes Too Long
**Mitigation**: Prioritize scenarios, can cut non-critical ones if short on time

---

## SUCCESS INDICATORS

✅ **Phase 12.1 Will Be Successful When**:
- 8+ participants complete sessions
- 80%+ average task completion rate
- 15-25 unique usability issues identified
