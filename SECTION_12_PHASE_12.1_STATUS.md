## POTENTIAL ISSUES & MITIGATION

### Issue: Website Down or Bug Found
**Mitigation**: 
- Have backup test website URL
- Use sandbox/demo account
- Document issue and adjust scenario if needed
- Don't let participant know it's unexpected

### Issue: Participant Doesn't Show Up
**Mitigation**:
- Call/text 30 min before (confirm attendance)
- Have 1-2 backup participants on standby
- Reschedule ASAP
- Adjust schedule grid

### Issue: Participant Struggles on Scenario
**Mitigation**:
- Let them struggle for 2-3 minutes (important feedback)
- Ask "What are you thinking?"
- Don't hint or help (unless truly stuck)
- Note observation: "User struggled to find [X]"
- Move on to next scenario if time short

### Issue: Technical Problems (Zoom, Recording)
**Mitigation**:
- Test all tech 30 min before
- Have phone as backup camera
- Can test without recording (participant safety first)
- Manual notes are sufficient
